Once upon a time theres was little girl who liked to call herself Little Red Riding Hood. Her grandma was very ill so one day she decided to make some cookies and give them to her. Once she made the cookies she wrapped them in the basket and began walking through the forest to her grandmas house. On the way to her grandmas house, she sees a wolf! The wolf comes up to her and says "OOH GIVE ME THE COOKIES!!" Little Red says, "NO! These are for my grandma." The wolf, disappointed, walks away yelling, "You will pay for this". Finally, she reaches the house but something strange had happened! The door was wide open and in the house, the lights were all off. As she goes to her grandmas bed the wolf jumps on her and says, "Now give me the cookies". Scared of what will happen to her and her grandma, she gives the cookies to him. They all lived happily ever after. The End.
